        <ul class="items">
            <li>Oregano</li>  
            <li>Chilli Flakes</li>

        <p class="procedure">  <span class='procedure_name'>Procedure:</span> Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza.
             Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.
    
             Slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven.
             Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.
